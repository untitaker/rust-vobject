# VObject parser for Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/rust-vobject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/rust-vobject)

This is a primitive unstable vobject parser for Rust, originally written for [a
simple addressbook script](https://github.com/untitaker/mates.rs) and based on
[rust-peg](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-peg).

The author hasn't read the relevant RFCs, so this library handles all versions
of VCard and iCalendar equally badly.

It currently can't handle:

- Value escaping
- Multiline strings

See the testsuite for some basic usage. This is an experiment by me to learn
Rust, and the API is too imperfect to be documented. Suggestions are welcome.
